## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project I have learned more about and practiced positioning of elements, although I do
believe there is probably a better way of going about it that I will soon become aware of. I have also learned a bit about CSS Grid and its uses as well as flexbox. Something that icame across that i had not heard of before is the picture element. It allows the use of multiple pictures depending on whehter or not certain conditoins are met.

### Continued development

I want to continue practicing CSS to gain a better understanding  of what is going on before starting to use CSS frameworks.

### Useful resources

- [Picture Element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture) - This taught me about the picture element needed to display the correct picture depending on screen size
- [CSS Grid](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp) - This resource provided much information about using grid layouts
